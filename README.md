# V3rmillion-Copy-Code-Block-Button
This will add a copy button to every code block element on v3rmillion.


In order to use this, you'll need the Tampermonkey extension. (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)

This will most likely work in every mybb forum, you'll maybe just have to replace a few class names.

Check out this cool extended version of my script, which allows you to execute scripts directly from v3rmillion: https://github.com/Babyhamsta/Hamsta-s-Webhook
